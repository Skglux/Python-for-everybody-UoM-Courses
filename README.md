### 🧪 Checking the Layout
I’ve used a few specific Markdown features here:
* **Badges:** The `![Status]` and `[![License]]` lines create those colorful icons you see on many professional repos.
* **Code Blocks:** The "How to Run" section uses triple backticks (`` ``` ``) to make the command look like it's in a terminal.

Does this structure look like it covers everything you wanted to showcase, or should we add a section for **Future Goals** where you can list the upcoming chapters like Data Structures? 🚀
