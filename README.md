This repository contains my coursework, exercises, and projects for the **Python for Everybody** Specialization offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera.

## 📖 About the Course
The specialization covers the fundamentals of programming using Python, including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases. 

* **Instructor:** Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck)
* **Platform:** Coursera

## 📚 Course Topics 

* **Why we program**: [`c1_basicsyntax.py`](./c1_basicsyntax.py) — A simple script that uses the `print()` function to display text.
* **Variables and Expressions**: [`c2_variables.py`](./c2_variables.py) — Calculates total pay by taking user input for hours and rate, then converting them to floats.
* **Conditional Code**: [`c3_conditions.py`](./c3_conditions.py) — A grading tool that uses conditional logic (`if/elif/else`) to assign a letter grade based on a numeric score.
* **Functions**: [`c4_functions.py`](./c4_functions.py) — Uses a custom function and `try/except` blocks to calculate pay, including overtime rates.
* **Loops and Iteration**: [`c5_loops.py`](./c5_loops.py) — A loop-based program that continuously asks for numbers to identify the largest and smallest values until the user types "done".

## 💡 Key Takeaways
* **Error Handling**: Using `try` and `except` to prevent crashes from invalid user input.
* **Control Flow**: Implementing `while` loops and `if/elif/else` logic to create interactive programs.
* **Functions**: Designing reusable blocks of code with the `def` keyword to simplify calculations.
